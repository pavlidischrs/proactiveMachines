# Markers and MNIST images

The file **imagePattern.svg** was created in **Inkscape** to create the Markers and place the MNIST image inside. If you want to check other MNIST images inside all you have to do is to change the inner image. It is very easy with Inkscape! 

* Open the .svg file in Inkscape 
* Drop an image from the MNISTImages folder 
* On the top toolbar choose (x,y) = (250,450) and (W,H) = (250,250)


**Or** you can just use the **Paint** of Windows to cover (roughly) the inner image with a new one. It should work!
